# Superstore-sales-visualization

Designed and developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize sales performance and identify key trends from a complex Superstore dataset.

Performed comprehensive data cleaning and transformation using Power Query, ensuring data accuracy and usability for reporting.

Created insightful visualizations (e.g., sales over time, profit by region, customer segmentation) and used DAX to build custom metrics like 'Profit Margin' and 'Sales Growth'.

Enabled stakeholders to track sales patterns, optimize inventory, and improve marketing strategies through actionable, data-driven insights.
